# Minor Updates and Bug Fixes

This page describes minor updates and bug fixes included in Dyalog v20.0.

[`)SAVE`](https://docs.dyalog.com/20.0/language-reference-guide/system-commands/save/)  
You can no longer overwrite a workspace that was saved with an earlier version of Dyalog without using the `-force` option. This was already required on Microsoft Windows, but is now required on all supported operating systems.

**&lt;RD>** – The _Reformat_ command  
The ability to reformat JSON text has been extended to also reformat JSON5 text.

**.aplf** Files  
The interpreter now assumes that a file with the **.aplf** extension contains a function definition unless there are explicit instructions indicating otherwise within the file.

Microsoft Windows IDE

* The [**Find Objects** tool](https://docs.dyalog.com/20.0/windows-ui-guide/find-objects-tool/) now allows a user to select and copy mulitple entries from the results.
* When applying a caption to a label, exceeding 1,023 characters now gives a `LIMIT ERROR` rather than crashing the interpreter (64-bit only).

.NET Framework v4.x  
Dyalog no longer crashes if you call `⎕CLEAR` after creating a link and using `-watch=both`.

[PrintToPDF](https://docs.dyalog.com/20.0/object-reference/methodorevents/printtopdf/) (Method 845, specific to the HTMLRenderer)  
Additional arguments can now be supplied to tailor the generated PDF output.

Memory Manager Performance  
Prior to Dyalog v20.0, the performance of the memory manager was poor if there were namespaces that did not have a name referring to them but only continued to exist because they were parents of other namespaces. For example, using `⎕JSON` to create a namespace, then immediately extracting a child name space from that result using `records←(⎕JSON text).Data.Records`, creates a vector of namespaces that all have `Data` as their parent, but no name references `Data` itself. This has now been resolved, and the suggested workaround of assigning a name to the top-level namespace is no longer required.
