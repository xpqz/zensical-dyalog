## Unicode and Classic Editions

Dyalog is available in two separate editions:  

* The _Unicode_ edition is Dyalog’s strategic edition; it is the edition that is generally available, and the only one available to new users. It is compatible with many third-party applications and tools, is capable of handling data from third-party tools and websites, and can be used with source code management systems (such as Git) to store APL code.
* The _Classic_ edition is only available for existing customers who have been using Dyalog for a long time and for whom moving to the Unicode edition would involve considerable effort.

## 32-Bit and 64-Bit Widths

Two separate widths of Dyalog for Microsoft Windows are available. The 32-bit width  will run on both 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems; the 64-bit width will only run on a 64-bit operating system.

## Files

The names of the files that are included in a Dyalog installation can vary slightly between the different editions and widths.

|**.dse**     |Dyalog Session              |

!!! Info "Information"
    Some of these extensions (notably **.dcf**, **.dlf**, **.dot**, and **.DXF**) are not unique to Dyalog, and conflict with the same extensions used by other software applications. Although all the above file extensions are associated with Dyalog during its installation, these associations could subsequently be changed by the installation of other software or by a Microsoft Windows System restore.
