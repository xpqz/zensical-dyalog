# System Requirements

This page describes the hardware and software requirements for Dyalog v21.0. 

## Supported Dyalog Versions

Current version: Dyalog v21.0  
Previous supported versions: Dyalog v20.0 and v19.0  

Dyalog v18.2 and earlier versions are no longer supported.  

### Supported Platforms

* IBM AIX:
    * AIX 7.3 SP4 onwards with a POWER9 chip or higher
* Linux:
    * x86_64: Built on Ubuntu 22.04
    * ARM64: Built on Debian GNU/Linux 13
* macOS (Apple Silicon):
    *  macOS 26.3 (Tahoe) onwards
* Microsoft Windows (Intel-based):
    * Windows 11 version 25H2 onwards (Windows Server 2016 onwards)
* Raspberry Pi (ARM-based): 
    * 64-bit: Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm or later  
    NOTE: Installed using the Linux ARM64 package
    * Not supported on Raspberry Pi Pico

## External .NET Requirements  

### .NET

The .NET interface requires version 10.0 of Microsoft .NET or higher. 
 
!!! Info "Information"
    Dyalog v21.0 supports .NET v10.0 and later, but is configured to support .NET v10.0 by default. To support a later version of .NET, minor amendments are needed to two of the files installed with Dyalog – see [Installing .NET](https://docs.dyalog.com/21.0/net-interface-guide/installation/#installing-net) for more information.

### Microsoft .NET Framework

The .NET Framework interface requires version 4.0 or greater of Microsoft .NET Framework. It does not operate with earlier versions of the .NET Framework. In addition: 
 
* Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 is needed for full data binding support.  
Note: This includes support for the <code class="language-other">INotifyCollectionChanged</code> interface, which is used by Dyalog to notify a data consumer when the contents of a variable that is data bound as a list of items changes.  
* IIS (and ASP.NET) need to be installed before installing Dyalog. If these are not present when Dyalog is installed, the **[DYALOG]/Samples/asp.net** directory will not be installed.  

## Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)

Dyalog v21.0 is supplied with CEF version 138 on all supported platforms.

In versions of CEF supplied with Dyalog v19.0 and earlier, pop-ups and light mode were enabled by default. This changed with Dyalog v20.0. To minimise differences between Dyalog v19.0 (and earlier) and Dyalog v20.0 (and later) when using CEF-based applications, two temporary environment variables (not configuration parameters) have been introduced to preserve these settings for Dyalog v20.0 (and later). These are:

- DYALOG_CEF_ALLOW_POPUPS<br />Specifies whether pop-ups are disabled for CEF-based applications (the default for CEF v138 depends on the operating system). Possible values are:
    - `1` : pop-ups are not disabled (equivalent to <code class="language-nonAPL">--disable-popup-blocking</code>)
	- any other value is ignored, and CEF's default (as determined by the user's operating system preferences) is used.  
	
	The default is `1`.
	
- DYALOG_CEF_DARK_MODE<br />Specifies whether CEF-based applications are displayed in dark or light mode (the default for CEF v138 is dark mode). Possible values are:
    - `0` : display using light mode (equivalent to <code class="language-nonAPL">--force-light-mode</code>)
    - `1` : display using dark mode (equivalent to <code class="language-nonAPL">--force-dark-mode</code>)
	- `2` : display using CEF's default (as determined by the user's operating system preferences)  
   
    The default is `2`.

### HTMLRenderer

The HTMLRenderer is supported on the following platforms:  

* Linux (x86_64 only)
* macOS
* Microsoft Windows  

To see which version of CEF was used when the HTMLRenderer was built, query the `CEFVersion` property of an instance of the HTMLRenderer:
```apl
      'hr' ⎕WC 'HTMLRenderer'
      hr.CEFVersion[2 3]      ⍝ CEF major version and commit number
121 3
```
### Auxiliary Processors

If the configuration parameter `ENABLE_CEF` is `1`, Auxiliary Processors cannot be used (they hang on error). By default, `ENABLE_CEF` is `1` (unless you are not running under a desktop, for example, you are running Dyalog in a PuTTY session; in this case the default is `0`).
