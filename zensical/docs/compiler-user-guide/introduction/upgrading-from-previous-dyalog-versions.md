<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Upgrading from Previous Versions of Dyalog</span></h1>

The format of the bytecode used for compiled functions in Dyalog v15.0 onwards is not compatible with the bytecode used for compiled functions in previous versions of Dyalog. When loading a workspace containing compiled functions that was saved by a previous version of Dyalog, all bytecode for compiled functions will be discarded and you must use [`400⌶`](../../language-reference-guide/primitive-operators/i-beam/compiler-control.md) to recompile them).
