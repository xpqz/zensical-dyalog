# Tally

```apl
R←≢Y
```
[Key to notation](../key-to-notation.md)

`Y` may be any array.  `R` is a simple numeric scalar.

Tally returns the number of major cells of `Y`. See [Cells and Sub-arrays](../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/arrays/cells-and-subarrays.md).

This can also be expressed as the length of the leading axis or 1 if `Y` is a scalar. _Tally_ is equivalent to the function `{⍬⍴(⍴⍵),1}`.

## Examples
```apl
      ≢2 3 4⍴⍳10
2
      ≢2
1
      ≢⍬
0
```

`≢V` is useful for returning the length of vector `V` as a scalar. (In contrast, `⍴V` is a one-element vector.)
