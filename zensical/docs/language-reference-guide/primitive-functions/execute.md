!!! Warning "Warning"
    If the argument to _execute_ could include user input, then there is a risk to data and systems. To reduce this risk, a system function might be more appropriate than the _execute_ function. For example:

	* use [`⎕VGET`](../system-functions/vget.md) or [`⎕VSET`](../system-functions/vset.md) to get or set the value of one or more variables named within one or more character vectors.
	* use [`⎕VFI`](../system-functions/vfi.md), [`⎕JSON`](../system-functions/json.md), or [`⎕CSV`](../system-functions/csv.md) to make numbers in text form into actual numbers.
    * use [`⎕OR`](../system-functions/or.md) to call a function by name; exact usage depends on valency. For example:
      * niladic – `(⎕OR fnName){⍺⍺}`
      * monadic – `(⎕OR fnName){⍺⍺ ⍵}YY`
      * dyadic – `X((⎕OR fnName){⍺ ⍺⍺ ⍵})Y`

`Y` must be a simple character scalar or vector containing an APL expression to be executed. The expression may contain one or more sub-expressions separated by `⋄` (Diamond) characters.

If the result of the expression is used or is assigned to a name,  `R` is the result (if any) of the last-executed sub-expression and the non-shy results of all preceding expressions (that are not assigned within the expression) are displayed. Otherwise the unassigned non-shy results of all of the sub-expressions are displayed.

If the expression is an empty vector or a vector containing only blanks or one that does not produce a result, then `⍎Y` has no value and using or assigning it to a name will generate `VALUE ERROR`.

If `Y` contains a branch expression, the branch is effected in the environment from which _execute_ was invoked, and `⍎Y` does not return.
