# <span class="name">First</span> <span class="command">(⎕ML) R←⊃Y or R←↑Y</span> {: .heading}



The symbol chosen to represent First depends on the current Migration Level.


If  `⎕ML<2`, First is represented by the symbol: `⊃`.


If  `⎕ML≥2`, First is represented by the symbol: `↑`.


`Y` may be any array. `R` is an array. If `Y` is non-empty, `R` is the value of the first item of `Y` taken in ravel order.  If `Y` is empty, `R` is the prototype of `Y`.


First is the inverse of Enclose. The identity `R←→⊃⊂R` holds for all `R`.  First is also referred to as Disclose.
