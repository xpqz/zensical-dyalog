<h1 class="heading"><span class="name">Without</span> <span class="command">R←X~Y</span></h1>

`X` must be a scalar or vector.  `R` is a vector of the elements of `X` excluding those elements which occur in `Y` taken in the order in which they occur in `X`.

Elements of `X` and `Y` are considered the same if `X≡Y` returns 1 for those elements.

`⎕CT` and `⎕DCT` are  implicit arguments of Without. Without is also known as Excluding.

      'MONDAY' 'TUESDAY' 'WEDNESDAY'~'TUESDAY' 'FRIDAY'
