# Power

```apl
R←X*Y
```
[Key to notation](../key-to-notation.md)

`Y` must be a numeric array.  `X` must be a numeric array.  `R` is numeric.  The value of `R` is `X` raised to the power of `Y`.

If `Y` is zero, `R` is defined to be 1.

If `X` is zero, `Y` must be non-negative.

In general, `X*Y` is defined as `*Y×⍟X`. If `X` is negative, the result `R` is likely to be complex.

## Examples
```apl
      2*2 ¯2
4 0.25
 
      9 64*0.5
