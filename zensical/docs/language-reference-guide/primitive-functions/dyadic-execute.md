!!! Warning "Warning"
    If the right argument to _dyadic execute_ could include user input, then there is a risk to data and systems. To reduce this risk, a system function might be more appropriate than the _dyadic execute_ function. For example:

	* use [`⎕VGET`](../system-functions/vget.md) or [`⎕VSET`](../system-functions/vset.md) to get or set the value of one or more variables named within one or more character vectors.
	* use [`⎕VFI`](../system-functions/vfi.md), [`⎕JSON`](../system-functions/json.md), or [`⎕CSV`](../system-functions/csv.md) to make numbers in text form into actual numbers.
    * use [`⎕OR`](../system-functions/or.md) to call a function by name; exact usage depends on valency. For example, in the namespace with the reference `nsRef`:
      * niladic – `(nsRef.⎕OR fnName)nsRef.{⍺⍺})⍬`
      * monadic – `(nsRef.⎕OR fnName)nsRef.{⍺⍺ ⍵}Y`
      * dyadic – `X((nsRef.⎕OR fnName)nsRef.{⍺ ⍺⍺ ⍵})Y`
      A namespace name can be resolved to a reference with `nsRef←⎕VGET nsName`.

`Y` must be a simple character scalar or vector containing an APL expression to be executed. The expression may contain one or more sub-expressions separated by `⋄` (Diamond) characters.

`X` must be a namespace reference or a simple character scalar or vector representing the name of a namespace in which the expression is to be executed. If `X` is an empty character vector, the expression is executed in the current space.

If the result of the expression is used or is assigned to a name,  `R` is the result (if any) of the last-executed sub-expression and the non-shy results of all preceding expressions (that are not assigned within the expression) are displayed. Otherwise the unassigned non-shy results of all of the sub-expressions are displayed.

If the expression is an empty vector or a vector containing only blanks or one that does not produce a result, then `X⍎Y` has no value and using or assigning it to a name will generate `VALUE ERROR`.

If `Y` contains a branch expression, the branch is effected in the environment from which the _dyadic execute_ was invoked, and `X⍎Y` does not return.

<h2 class="example">Examples</h2>

Using a named namespace:
```apl
      space←'myspace'
      space ⎕NS''
      space⍎'nums←⍳6'
      space⍎'nums'
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
Using a reference:
```apl
      space←⎕NS''
      space⍎'nums←⍳6'
      space⍎'nums'
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

!!! Hint "Hints and Recommendations"
    It is faster and (potentially) safer to use system functions instead of _dyadic execute_ in the above examples as follows:
    
    Using a named namespace:
    ```apl
          space←'myspace'
          space ⎕NS''
          space ⎕VSET⊂'nums'(⍳6)
          space ⎕VGET'nums'
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    ```
    Using a reference:
    ```apl
          space←⎕NS''
          space ⎕VSET⊂'nums'(⍳6)
          space ⎕VGET'nums'
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    ```
