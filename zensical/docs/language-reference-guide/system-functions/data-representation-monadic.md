# Data Representation (Monadic)

```apl
R←⎕DR Y
```
[Key to notation](../key-to-notation.md)

Monadic `⎕DR` returns the type of its argument `Y`.  The result `R` is an integer scalar containing one of the following values. The internal representation and data types for character data differ between the Unicode and Classic Editions.
