# Kill Thread `{R}←{X}⎕TKILL Y`

```apl
{R}←{X}⎕TKILL Y
```
[Key to notation](../key-to-notation.md)

`Y` must be a simple array of integers representing thread numbers to be terminated. `X` is a Boolean single, defaulting to 1, which indicates that all descendant threads should also be terminated.

The [shy](../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/results.md#shy-results) result `R` is a vector of the numbers of all threads that have been terminated.

The **base thread** 0 is always excluded from the cull.

## Examples
```apl
      ⎕TKILL 0            ⍝ Kill background threads.
 
      ⎕TKILL ⎕TID         ⍝ Kill self and descendants.
 
      0 ⎕TKILL ⎕TID       ⍝ Kill self only.
 
      ⎕TKILL ⎕TCNUMS ⎕TID ⍝ Kill descendants.
```
