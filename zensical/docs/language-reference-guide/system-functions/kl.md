# Key Label `R←⎕KL Y`

```apl
R←⎕KL Y
```
[Key to notation](../key-to-notation.md)

`Y` is a simple character vector or a vector of character vectors containing Input Codes for Keyboard Shortcuts. In the Classic Edition, keystrokes are associated with Keyboard Shortcuts by the Input Translate Table.

`R` is a simple character vector or a vector of character vectors containing the labels associated with the codes.  If `Y` specifies codes that are not defined, the corresponding elements of `R` are the codes in `Y`.

`⎕KL` provides the information required to build device-independent help messages into applications, particularly full-screen applications using `⎕SM` and `⎕SR`.

## Examples
```apl
      ⎕KL 'RC'
Right
 
      ⎕KL 'ER' 'EP' 'QT' 'F1' 'F13'
  Enter  Esc  Shift+Esc  F1  Shift+F1
```

    In the Unicode edition, `⎕KL` can also get the keystrokes to type APL glyphs:
    ```apl
          ⎕KL '⌸'
    Control+Shift+K
    ```
