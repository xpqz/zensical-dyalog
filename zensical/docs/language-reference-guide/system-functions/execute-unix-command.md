# Execute Unix Command

```apl
{R}←⎕SH Y
```
[Key to notation](../key-to-notation.md)

`⎕SH` executes a UNIX shell or a Windows Command Processor.  `⎕SH` is a synonym of `⎕CMD`.  Either function may be used in either environment (UNIX or Windows) with exactly the same effect.  `⎕SH` is probably more natural for the UNIX user.  This section describes the behaviour of `⎕SH` and `⎕CMD` under UNIX.  See [Execute Windows Command](execute-windows-command.md) for a discussion of the behaviour of these system functions under Windows.

The system commands [`)SH`](../system-commands/sh.md) and [`)CMD`](../system-commands/cmd.md) provide similar facilities.

`Y` must be a simple character scalar or vector representing a UNIX shell command.  `R` is a nested vector of character vectors.

`Y` may be any acceptable UNIX command. If the command does not produce any output, `R` is `0⍴⊂''` but the result is [shy](../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/results.md#shy-results).  If the command has a non-zero exit code, then APL will signal a `DOMAIN ERROR`.  If the command returns a result and has a zero exit code, then each element of `R` will be a line from the standard output (stdout) of the command.  Output from standard error (stderr) is not captured unless redirected to stdout.

See also [`⎕SHELL`](shell.md).

## Examples
```apl
      ⎕SH'ls'
FILES WS temp
 
      ⎕SH 'rm WS/TEST'
 
      ⎕SH 'grep bin /etc/passwd ; exit 0'
bin:!:2:2::/bin:
 
      ⎕SH 'apl MYWS <inputfile >out1 2>out2 &'
```

!!! Info "Information"
    This function is disabled and instead generates a `DOMAIN ERROR` if the RIDE_SPAWNED parameter is non-zero. This is designed to prevent it being invoked from a Ride session which does not support this type of user interface. For further details, see the [Ride User Guide](https://dyalog.github.io/ride).
