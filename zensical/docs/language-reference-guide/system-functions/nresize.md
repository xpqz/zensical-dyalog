# Native File Resize `{R}←X ⎕NRESIZE Y`

```apl
{R}←X ⎕NRESIZE Y
```
[Key to notation](../key-to-notation.md)

This function changes the size of a native file.

`Y` is a negative integer tie number associated with a tied native file.

`X` is a single integer value that specifies the new size of the file in bytes.  If `X` is smaller than the current file size, the file is truncated.  If `X` is larger than the current file size, the file is extended and the value of additional bytes is undefined.

The [shy](../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/results.md#shy-results) result of `⎕NRESIZE` is the tie number of the resized file.
