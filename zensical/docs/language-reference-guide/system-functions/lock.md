# Lock Definition `{R}←{X}⎕LOCK Y`

```apl
{R}←{X}⎕LOCK Y
```
[Key to notation](../key-to-notation.md)

`Y` must be a simple character scalar, or vector which is taken to be the name of a defined function or operator in the active workspace. `⎕LOCK` does not apply to dfns or derived functions.

The active referent to the name in the workspace is locked.  Stop, trace and monitor settings, established by the `⎕STOP`, `⎕TRACE` and `⎕MONITOR` functions, are cancelled.

The optional left argument `X` specifies to what extent the function code is hidden. `X` can be `0`, `1`, `2`, or `3` (the default) with the following meaning:

- `0`: The argument is well-formed, but could not be locked (for example, it is a dfn).
- `1`: The object may not be displayed and you may not obtain its character form using `⎕ATX`, `⎕CR`, `⎕NR`, or `⎕VR`.
- `2`: If an error or exception occurs that would normally cause a suspension of execution within the locked function or operator, the state indicator is cut back to the statement that called it and the suspension is triggered there instead.
- `3`: Both `1` and `2` apply. You can neither display the locked object nor suspend execution within it.

Locks are additive, so that
```apl
      1 ⎕LOCK'FOO' ⋄ 2 ⎕LOCK'FOO'
```

is equivalent to:
```apl
      3 ⎕LOCK'FOO'
```

The [shy](../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/results.md#shy-results) result `R` is the lock state (`1`, `2`, or `3`) of `Y`.

A `DOMAIN ERROR` is reported if `Y` is ill-formed.

## Examples
```apl
      ⎕FX'r←foo' 'r←10'
      62 ⎕ATX'foo'  
  r←foo   r←10 
      ≢62 ⎕ATX'foo'
2
      ⎕LOCK'foo'
      ≢62 ⎕ATX'foo'
0
```
