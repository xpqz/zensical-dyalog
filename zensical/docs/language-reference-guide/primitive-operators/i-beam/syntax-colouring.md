# Syntax Colouring

```apl
R←200⌶Y
```
[Key to notation](../../key-to-notation.md)

This function obtains syntax colouring information for a function.

`Y` is a vector of character vectors containing the `⎕NR` representation of a function or operator.

`R` is a vector of integer vectors with the same shape and structure of `Y` in which each number identifies the syntax colour element associated with the corresponding character in `Y`.

```apl
      ∇foo∇
     ∇ foo;local
[1]    global
[2]    local←⍴⍴'hello'
     ∇
      ⎕NR 'foo'
  foo;local   global   local←⍴⍴'hello' 
 
     {(↑⍵),↑200⌶⍵}⎕NR 'foo'
 foo;local       3 21 21 21 19 34 34 34 34 34 0 0 0 0 0 0
 global          3  7  7  7  7  7  7  0  0  0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 local←⍴⍴'hello' 3 34 34 34 34 34 19 23 23  4 4 4 4 4 4 4

```

In this example:

|---|-------------------------------------------------|
|21 |is the syntax identifier for "character constant"|
|19 |is the syntax identifier for "primitive"         |
|3  |is the syntax identifier for "white space"       |
|34 |is the syntax identifier for "local name"        |
|7  |is the syntax identifier for "global name"       |
|23 |is the syntax identifier for "idiom"             |

The list of syntax colour elements supported by the current interpreter is given by `201⌶`. The values can change within a release, and are very likely to change across releases, so it is important that you always call `201⌶` rather than rely on the results from a different interpreter. See [Syntax Colour Tokens](syntax-colour-tokens.md).
