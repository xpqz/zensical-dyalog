# Disable Component Checksum Validation `{R}←3002⌶Y`

```apl
{R}←3002⌶Y
```
[Key to notation](../../key-to-notation.md)

Checksums allow component files to be validated and repaired using [`⎕FCHK`](../../system-functions/fchk.md).

From Version 13.1 onwards, components which contain checksums are also validated on every component read.

Although not recommended, applications which favour performance over security may disable checksum validation by `⎕FREAD` using this function.

`Y` is an integer defined as follows:

|Value|Description                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|0    |`⎕FREAD` will not validate checksums.                                       |
|1    |`⎕FREAD` will validate checksums when they are present. This is the default.|

The [shy](../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/results.md#shy-results) result `R` is the previous value of this setting.
