# Log Use of Deprecated Features `{R}←(13⌶)Y`

```apl
{R}←(13⌶)Y
```
[Key to notation](../../key-to-notation.md)

Controls which deprecated features are logged when logging is enabled. For an overview of deprecated features and this _I-beam_'s role in identifying them within your code, see [Deprecated functionality](../../../programming-reference-guide/deprecated-functionality.md).

`Y` is a character vector, or a vector of character vectors, each containing the name of a deprecated feature, or one of the names defined in the table below. The names are release-dependent; for a list of valid names see the [Release Notes](../../../release-notes/announcements/deprecated-functionality.md).

Subsequent uses of the selected deprecated features will be logged, provided that [`109⌶`](log-file-for-deprecations.md) has been called to set the name of the log file.

If `13⌶` is called again, the list of features that are logged is replaced.

The result `R` is a vector of zero or more names, as described in the table below.

|Value(s) in `Y`|Meaning|Value(s) in `R`|[Shy?](../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/results.md#shy-results)|
|---|---|---|---|
|*Feature names*|Enable logging of the specified features|Names of features for which logging is enabled|Yes|
|`'All'`|Enable logging of all deprecated features, including any that are not documented|`'All'`, as a character vector|Yes|
|`'None'`|Disable logging of deprecated features|`0⍴⊂''` (an empty vector of names)|Yes|
|`'Enabled'`|List the features for which logging is enabled|Names of the features for which logging is enabled, or `'All'`|No|
|`'List'`|List the documented deprecated features|Names of the documented deprecated features|No|

`13⌶'List'` reports only the deprecated features that are documented in the [Release Notes](../../../release-notes/announcements/deprecated-functionality.md). `13⌶'All'` enables logging for all of these and for any further features that are not yet documented; Dyalog Ltd recommends enabling logging with `13⌶'All'` rather than with `13⌶ 13⌶'List'`. When `'All'` is selected, the set of enabled features is recorded as the character vector `'All'` rather than as the individual feature names; this value is returned by both `13⌶'All'` (shy) and a subsequent `13⌶'Enabled'`.

!!! tip "Hints and Recommendations"
    If, after selecting `13⌶'All'`, you see logged messages that name features you do not recognise, you are using undocumented deprecated features and might want to contact [support@dyalog.com](mailto:support@dyalog.com) for help.

Before any logging information is created, the log file must also be configured using [`109⌶`](log-file-for-deprecations.md). Without selecting a log file, all logging is silently discarded.

Each log entry is a complete JSON5 object definition that includes the following items:

* `TS`: a timestamp.
* `Type`: a description of the entry type (always `'Warning'`).
* `Message`: a message associated with the log entry (always `'Use of deprecated feature'`).
* `Feature`: a description of the deprecated feature.
* `ExtraInfo`: feature-specific additional information (can be an empty string).
* `WSID`: the name of the workspace in which the feature was used.
* `Stack`: an array of strings indicating the SIstack at the point the feature was used.

## Example

```apl
      13⌶'List'
 This  That  TheOther 
      13⌶'Enabled'

      13⌶'That' 'This'
      13⌶'Enabled'
 This  That
      13⌶'All'
      13⌶'Enabled'
All
```
