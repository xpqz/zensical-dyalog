# Close All Windows `R←2023⌶Y`

```apl
R←2023⌶Y
```
[Key to notation](../../key-to-notation.md)

Under Windows the option, *Windows -> Close All Windows* allows the user to close all open Editor and Tracer Windows, but does not reset the *state indicator*.

This _I-beam_ mimics this behaviour, thus allowing the user to write code which can close all windows before attempting to save the workspace; with the exception of calling `0 ⎕SAVE` it is not possible to save a workspace if any editor or tracer windows are open.

Under non-Windows operating systems this is the only mechanism for closing all such windows. This _I-beam_ is effective in Ride too.

## Example
```apl
      2023⌶0    
```
