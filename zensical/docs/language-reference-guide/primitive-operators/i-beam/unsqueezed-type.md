# Unsqueezed Type `R←181⌶Y`

```apl
R←181⌶Y
```
[Key to notation](../../key-to-notation.md)

`Y` is any array.

The result `R` is an integer scalar containing an integer value which indicates the type of the array.
 For further information see [Data Representation (Monadic)](../../system-functions/data-representation-monadic.md).

`181⌶` is functionally identical to monadic `⎕DR`, except that no attempt is made to squeeze the data into smaller data types. `⎕DR` always attempts to squeeze the data; `181⌶` does not, but if a workspace compaction occurs during execution of `181⌶`, the data may still be squeezed before the type is identified.

## Example
```apl

      ⎕DR 1↑1 1000
11
      (181⌶) 1↑1 1000
163
```
