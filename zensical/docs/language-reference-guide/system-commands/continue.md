# Save Continuation `)CONTINUE`

```apl
)CONTINUE
```

This command saves the active workspace in the current working directory and ends the Dyalog session. The name of the workspace file is CONTINUE in upper-case with the extension defined by the [`WSEXT` parameter](../../windows-installation-and-configuration-guide/configuration-parameters/configuration-parameters.md).

The values of all system variables (including [`⎕SM`](../system-functions/sm.md)) and GUI objects are also saved in `CONTINUE`.

When a `CONTINUE` workspace is loaded, the latent expression (if any) is NOT executed.
