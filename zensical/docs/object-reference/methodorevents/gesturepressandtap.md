# GesturePressAndTap

Event 497

This event is reported when the presses one finger on an object and then taps it with a second finger.

The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq.md), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 5-element vector as follows :

|---|---|---|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event|`'GesturePressAndTap'` or 497|
|`[3]`|Flags|integer which reports the state of the gesture|
|`[4]`|Location|2-element integer vector containing the y and x-position respectively of the point midway between the two fingers. These are reported in pixel coordinates relative to the origin (top-left corner) of the object reporting the event..|
|`[5]`|Offset|3-element integer vector whose first element is (currently) 0 and whose second and third elements contain the (y,x) offset of the second finger relative to the first.|

The Flags parameter [3] which reports the state of the Gesture, is an integer with the value 0, 1 (*GF_BEGIN*), or 4 (*GF_END*):

|----------|-----|------------------------|
|Name      |Value|Description             |
|&nbsp;    |0    |A gesture is in progress|
|`GF_BEGIN`|1    |A gesture is starting.  |
|`GF_END`  |4    |A gesture has finished. |

When the user taps with his second finger, the object generates a GesturePressAndTap event with a `Flags` parameter of 1 (`GF_BEGIN`). Subsequently, until the user removes his first finger, it generates a series of GesturePressAndTap events with a `Flags` parameter of 0.  When the user lifts his first finger away, the object generates a final GesturePressAndTap  event, with a `Flags` parameter of 4 (`GF_END`)

No other event will be reported between the start and end of a series of GesturePressAndTap events.

The associated callback is run **immediately** while the windows notification is still on the stack. See [High-Priority Callback Functions](../../interface-guide/introduction/high-priority-callbacks.md).

Returning zero from the callback disables any default handling by the operating system.
