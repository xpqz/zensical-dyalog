# DropFiles

Event 450

If enabled, this event is reported when the user drags a file icon or a set of file icons and drops them onto the object. The system takes no action other than to report the event.

The event is only reported if [AcceptFiles](../properties/acceptfiles.md) is set to 1.

The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 5-element vector as follows :

|---|---|---|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event|`'DropFiles'` or 450|
|`[3]`|Files|Vector of character vectors containing the file names.|
|`[4]`|Item number|Integer. The index of the item within the object onto which the file(s) was dropped. Applies only to objects that have an [Items](../properties/items.md) property such as List, [ListView](../objects/listview.md) and [TreeView](../objects/treeview.md) .|
|`[5]`|Shift state|Integer. Sum of 1=shift key, 2=Ctrl key, 4=Alt key|
