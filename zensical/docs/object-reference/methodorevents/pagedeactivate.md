# PageDeactivate

Event 361

If enabled, this event is reported when the user switches from one [PropertyPage](../objects/propertypage.md) to another in a [PropertySheet](../objects/propertysheet.md) object. This event is reported by the old page *after* the page change has occurred and the page change may not be disabled by a callback function.

The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 2-element vector as follows :

|-----|------|-------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector  |
|`[2]`|Event |`'PageDeactivate'` or 361|

## Application
