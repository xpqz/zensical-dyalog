# GotFocus

Event 40

If enabled, this event is generated when the user has moved the keyboard focus to a new object by clicking the left mouse button, pressing TAB, or using a cursor key.

The event message reported as the result of [`⎕DQ`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq.md), or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 3-element vector as follows :

|-----|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Object     |ref or character vector                                         |
|`[2]`|Event      |`'GotFocus'` or 40                                              |
|`[3]`|Object name|character vector (name of object which previously had the focus)|

The third element (object name) is empty if the focus was obtained from another application window.

The GotFocus event is generated **after** the focus has changed. The default processing is therefore to take no action. However, if you disable the event by setting its action code to `¯1`, or inhibit it by returning a 0 from your callback function, the focus is automatically restored to the object (or external application) that had lost it.
