# ClickComment

Event 225

If enabled, a ClickComment event is generated when the user clicks the mouse in a comment window of a [Grid](../objects/grid.md).

The event message reported as the result of `⎕DQ`, or supplied as the right argument to your callback function, is a 4-element vector as follows :

|-----|------|-----------------------|
|`[1]`|Object|ref or character vector|
|`[2]`|Event |`'ClickComment'` or 225|
|`[3]`|Row   |integer                |
|`[4]`|Column|integer                |

The event message reports the co-ordinates of the cell. The default action is to raise the comment window so that it appears above all other, potentially overlapping, comment windows.

If the comment window relates to a row or column *title*, the value reported in element [3] or [4] of the event message is `¯1`.
