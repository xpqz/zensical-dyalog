# OLEAddEventSink

Method 540

This method connects a named event sink to a COM object and adds the events defined by that event sink to the [EventList](../properties/eventlist.md) property of the associated namespace.

The argument to OLEAddEventSink is a single item as follows:

|-----|---------------|----------------|
|`[1]`|Event sink name|character vector|

The result is a number that represents the handle of the event sink. This may be subsequently required.
