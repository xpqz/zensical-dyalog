# SM

Object

Defines a window for `⎕SM` / `⎕SR` .

This object defines a window for `⎕SM`/`⎕SR` and allows you to combine the functionality of `⎕SM`/`⎕SR` with the "windows" GUI. For example, you can define a [Form](form.md) with a [MenuBar](menubar.md) at the top and a `⎕SM` window beneath it, with perhaps some [Button](button.md)s alongside.

To allow the user to interact with both `⎕SM` and other top-level objects, you must specify the names of these objects in the right argument of `⎕SR`. Thus the statement:
```apl
      CTX ← KEYS CTX ⎕SR 1 2 3 'Form1'
```

allows the user to interact with fields (rows) 1-3 of `⎕SM` **and** with the object `'Form1'` and its children. Callback functions associated with events in `'Form1'` will be executed automatically by `⎕SR`. If an enabled event without a callback occurs, the event will be placed on [`⎕DQ`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/dq.md)'s internal queue and `⎕SR` will terminate. The nature of the termination (that is, that it was caused by an event in an object) is reported by the value 131072 (2*17) in the fourth element of `⎕SR`'s result. The specific event ([Configure](../methodorevents/configure.md), [MouseUp](../methodorevents/mouseup.md), etc.) is however not reported. It is therefore generally preferable to use callbacks.

The [Posn](../properties/posn.md), [Size](../properties/size.md) and [Coord](../properties/coord.md) properties allow you to specify the position and size of the window occupied by `⎕SM` within its parent [Form](form.md). However, the `⎕SM` window is automatically sized to be an exact number of characters in height and width, which is reported in `⎕SD`.

The [Border](../properties/border.md) property may be used to specify a border around the outside of the `⎕SM` window. It is a number with the value 0 (no border) or 1 (1 pixel border). The default is 0. The [EdgeStyle](../properties/edgestyle.md) property may be used to give the object a 3-dimensional appearance. Its default value is `'Recess'`. The area within the SM object that is defined by `⎕SM` is necessarily a multiple of the character size. The region between this area and the outer edges of the object is coloured by the background colour specified by [BCol](../properties/bcol.md), or may be filled with a bitmap specified by [Picture](../properties/picture.md).

If the user resizes the [Form](form.md) which contains the SM object, the SM object will generate a [Configure](../methodorevents/configure.md) event if enabled. If the [Configure](../methodorevents/configure.md) event is not enabled, `⎕SR` will terminate with a `RESIZE` error which can be trapped using `⎕TRAP`. Either method can be used to reformat `⎕SM` as appropriate.

The [MouseDown](../methodorevents/mousedown.md) event can be used to bring up a pop-up menu. However, mouse events are not reported over `⎕SM` fields because `⎕SR` uses these to position the cursor.

The illustration shown below was produced as follows :
```apl
      'TEST'      ⎕WC 'Form' 'SM Object' (60 10)(40 50)
      'TEST.MB'   ⎕WC 'MenuBar'
      'TEST.MB.F' ⎕WC 'Menu' '&File'
      'TEST.MB.O' ⎕WC 'Menu' '&Options'
      'TEST.B1'   ⎕WC 'Button' '&OK' (84 2)
      'TEST.B2'   ⎕WC 'Button' '&Cancel' (84 78)
      'TEST.S'    ⎕WC 'SM'(2 2)(80 96)('BCol'192 192 192)
      ⎕SM←↑('The answer is' 5 10)(42 5 30)
```
