# Metafile

Object

This object represents a picture in Windows Metafile format.

The Windows Metafile is a mechanism for representing a picture in terms of a collection of graphical components. Windows Metafiles are distributed in special files (.WMF) from which they are loaded into memory for use by an application. Once loaded a Metafile is a Windows "resource" that can be used in a variety of ways. The Metafile object represents this resource.

The [File](../properties/file.md) property specifies the name of a .WMF file from which the Metafile is to be loaded or to which it is to be saved. If you specify [File](../properties/file.md) with [`⎕WC`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/wc.md) the Metafile object is loaded from it. If you specify [File](../properties/file.md) with [`⎕WS`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/ws.md) no action takes place until you instruct the Metafile object to re-initialise itself from the file or to save itself to the file. These operations are performed using the [FileRead](../methodorevents/fileread.md) and [FileWrite](../methodorevents/filewrite.md) methods. If you omit the [File](../properties/file.md) property in the argument to [`⎕WC`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/wc.md) or if you specify a null vector, the Metafile object is initially empty. The following example loads the picture defined by the GOLF.WMF Metafile that is distributed with Microsoft Office.
```apl
      'GOLF' ⎕WC 'Metafile' 'C:\MSOFFICE\CLIPART\GOLF'
```

Whether or not the Metafile object is initialised from a file, you can add graphical components to it by creating child objects. However the Metafile behaves like a [Bitmap](bitmap.md) object in that its children cannot be modified using [`⎕WS`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/ws.md) nor can they be removed using `⎕EX`. The components of a Metafile that has been initialised from a .WMF file also cannot be referenced in any way. It is therefore recommended that you use unnamed objects when you create the graphical components of a Metafile.

The following statements create an empty Metafile called `MF` and then draw a line and circle in it.
```apl
      'MF' ⎕WC 'Metafile'
      'MF.' ⎕WC 'Poly' (50(10 90))
      'MF.' ⎕WC 'Circle' (50 50) 30
```

Like the [Bitmap](bitmap.md), [Icon](icon.md), [Font](font.md) and [Cursor](cursor.md) objects, the Metafile is a resource that is not visible until it is *used*. This is done by setting the [Picture](../properties/picture.md) property of another object ([Form](form.md), [Image](image.md), [Static](static.md) or [SubForm](subform.md)) to the name of, or ref to, the Metafile object. For example, to display the Metafile `MF` in a [Form](form.md), you could type :
```apl
      'TEST' ⎕WC 'FORM' ('Picture' 'MF')
```

You can also copy a Metafile object to the Windows Clipboard from where it can be pasted into another application. This is done by creating a [Clipboard](clipboard.md) object and then setting its [MetafileObj](../properties/metafileobj.md) property to the name of the Metafile object to be exported. For example :
```apl
      'CL' ⎕WC 'Clipboard'
      'CL' ⎕WS 'MetafileObj' 'MF'
```

The [FileWrite](../methodorevents/filewrite.md) method may be used to save a Metafile object on a file. The following statements save the Metafile `MF` in a file called TEST.WMF.
```apl
      MF.File←'TEST'
      MF.FileWrite
```

The [Size](../properties/size.md) property determines the granularity of  the Metafile. Its default value is the size of its parent. If you intend to replay the Metafile at higher resolution, you should set [Size](../properties/size.md) accordingly.

The [RealSize](../properties/realsize.md) property specifies the suggested size of a Metafile in units of 0.01mm. Setting [RealSize](../properties/realsize.md) has the effect of making the Metafile *placeable*. Certain programs (such as Word for Windows) only support placeable metafiles.
