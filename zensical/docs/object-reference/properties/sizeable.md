# Sizeable

Property

This property determines whether or not an object can be directly resized by the user once it has been created by [`⎕WC`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/wc.md).

It is a single number with the value 0 (the object cannot be resized by the user) or 1 (the object may be resized by the user). The default is 1.

For a [Form](../objects/form.md) , [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md) or [SubForm](../objects/subform.md), the Sizeable property may only be set by [`⎕WC`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/wc.md) and cannot subsequently be altered using [`⎕WS`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/ws.md). An attempt to do so generates a `NONCE ERROR`. For a [Form](../objects/form.md) or [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md), the default value is 1 and the object occupies a standard resizeable window with a border. The value of Sizeable is independent of the values of the [MaxButton](maxbutton.md) and [MinButton](minbutton.md) properties, so that a [Form](../objects/form.md) or [HTMLRenderer](../objects/htmlrenderer.md) with [MaxButton](maxbutton.md) 1 can be maximised even though its Sizeable property is 0.

For other objects, the default value of the Sizeable property is 0. However, setting it to 1 (which may be done dynamically using [`⎕WS`](../../language-reference-guide/system-functions/ws.md)) allows the user to resize it with the mouse.

In all these cases, when the user resizes an object, the object will generate a [Configure](../methodorevents/configure.md) (31) event.

Sizeable also applies to the [Locator](../objects/locator.md) object. In this case, a value of 1 implies "rubberbanding" and a value of 0 means "no rubberbanding". See [Locator](../objects/locator.md) object for further details.
