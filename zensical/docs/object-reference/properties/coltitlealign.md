# ColTitleAlign

Property

The ColTitleAlign property specifies the alignment of column titles. For a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) object this is only relevant only when the [View](view.md) property is set to `'Report'`. ColTitleAlign is either a simple character vector, or a vector of character vectors with one element per column.

For a [Grid](../objects/grid.md), ColTitleAlign may be:'Top', `'Bottom'`, `'Left'`, `'Right'`, `'Centre'`, `'TopLeft'`, `'TopRight'`, `'BottomLeft'`, or `'BottomRight'`.

For a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) object, ColTitleAlign may be `'Left'`, `'Right'` or `'Centre'`. Also, for a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) the column data itself is aligned likewise. The *first* column in a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) is always left-aligned regardless of the setting of ColTitleAlign. This is a Windows restriction.

Both spellings `'Centre'` and `'Center'` are accepted.

## Application

Objects: [Grid](../objects/grid.md), [ListView](../objects/listview.md)
