# CalendarCols

Property

The CalendarCols property specifies the colours used for various elements in the [Calendar](../objects/calendar.md) object.

CalendarCols is a 6-element integer vector whose elements specify the colours as follows:

|-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`[1]`|Background colour displayed between months                                                                                                                                      |
|`[2]`|Background colour displayed within the month.                                                                                                                                   |
|`[3]`|Text colour within a month                                                                                                                                                      |
|`[4]`|Background colour displayed in the calendar's title                                                                                                                             |
|`[5]`|Colour used to display text within the calendar's title                                                                                                                         |
|`[6]`|Colour used to display header day and trailing day text. Header and trailing days are the days from the previous and following months that appear on the current month calendar.|

Each element of CalendarCols can be 0 (which means default colour), a negative singleton that specifies a particular Windows colour, or a 3-element integer vector of RGB values.

!!! note "Legacy"
    CalendarCols is ignored unless [Native Look and Feel](../miscellaneous/windows-xp-look-and-feel.md) is disabled, that is, unless the [**XPLookAndFeel**](../../windows-installation-and-configuration-guide/configuration-parameters/xplookandfeel.md) configuration parameter is set to `0`. Because the default value of that parameter is `1`, the property has no effect unless you change it.

!!! Info "Information"
    Setting the first element of CalendarCols currently has no effect. Dyalog Ltd believes this to be a Microsoft Windows problem that might be corrected in due course.
