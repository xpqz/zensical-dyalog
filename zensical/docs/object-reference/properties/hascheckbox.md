# HasCheckBox

Property

Specifies whether or not a checkbox is displayed alongside the value in a DateTimePicker.

HasCheckBox is a single number with the value 0 (the default) or 1. If HasCheckBox is 1, the user may set or clear the checkbox to indicate whether or not the date/time displayed in the object is to apply.

If the checkbox is not set, the [DateTimePicker](../objects/datetimepicker.md) is considered to be *empty* (the contents will be grayed out) and the value returned by the [DateTime](datetime.md) property is zilde. HasCheckBox can only be set when the object is created.

## Application

Objects: [DateTimePicker](../objects/datetimepicker.md)
