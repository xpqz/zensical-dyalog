# ReportBCol

Property

In Report View, the ReportBCol property is either a scalar or a matrix  that specifies the background colours for each item displayed in a [ListView](../objects/listview.md) object .

Its first column refers to the [Items](items.md) themselves, and subsequent columns to the elements of [ReportInfo](reportinfo.md).

That is, if non-scalar, `(⍴ReportBCol)←→(0 1+⍴ReportInfo)`

Each  element of ReportBCol is either an integer colour value or a 3-element of RGB colour indices.

For further information, see ["BCol"](bcol.md).
